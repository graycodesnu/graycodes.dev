# graycodes.dev

## Introduction

Built using React, this is the third iteration of my portfolio and the first iteration of [graycodes.dev](https://graycodes.dev/). I had a blast using Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Firebase for the first time.

Previous portfolio iterations: [Version 1](https://github.com/graycodesnu/portfolioWeek02), [Version 2](https://github.com/graycodesnu/g-harvey-portfolio)
